    <p>I am from Utah, and love to play basketball! I am majoring in software engineering and excited to learn more about HTML. I am working on a window washing buisness while pursuing school!</p>

    <p>I love that BYUI is Christ centered.I am taking this course because it is required and am hoping to grow my knowledge in HTML, and it's good to learn about this becasue it expands your mind to understand better how websites work. I've been a member of the Church officailly since I was 8! I have a lot of favorite quotes and scriptures. </p>
